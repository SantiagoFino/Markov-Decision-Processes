# Policy-Iteration
This repository presents implementations for standar Policy-Iteration, Modified/Optimistc Policy Iteration and Policy Iteration for POMDP using, amingo others, numpy and scipy. 
This repository also includes a bunch of examples and a visualization nootebook for the results.

The implementation of these algorithms follows the theory described in Dynamic Programing and Optimal Control (Vol II) by Dimitri P. Bertsekas.
